"eslint-plugin-import-x": major

`eslint-plugin-import-x` is a fork of `eslint-plugin-import` that aims to provide a more performant and more lightweight version of the original plugin.

Due to the nature of the fork, all `eslint-plugin-import`'s git tags and releases have been copied over to `eslint-plugin-import-x`. This causes version conflicts when publishing new versions of `eslint-plugin-import-x`.

To prevent this, we have decided to publish a new major version of `eslint-plugin-import-x` that will not conflict with the original `eslint-plugin-import`'s versions.
